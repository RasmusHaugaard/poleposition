\section*{Abstract}
This paper examines the process of developing an autonomous scalextric toy car to achieve the fastest lap time on an unknown track.
Based on data from a digital gyroscope and a tachometer, a program on a microcontroller has been developed to map an arbitrary, unknown track.
A motor controlling program has been developed to optimize the lap time based on the map.
\\
Furthermore, an electromagnet has been designed to allow more downforce in corners and a linedetector has been designed to capture the start line.
A 3D printed chassis has been designed to fit the adjustments to the original car.
